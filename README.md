### Hi there 👋

<!--
**PilarCha/PilarCha** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- 🔭 A majority of my time right now is finding a Full-Time Software Engineer Remote Job
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS (about time)
- 💬 Ask me about split keyboards. Currently using Lily58 with Mod-m switches
- :smile: Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: Microsoft Zunes were highly underrated. I still used mine 12 years later
